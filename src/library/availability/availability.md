## Problem

You have a schedule object with a structure that includes a list of available slots per day of the week and a list of products, each with a duration, break time, notice period, and booking period. The goal is to generate a schedule of availability for these products over a period of time in 15-minute intervals, given a start date.

The generated schedule should:

Include only the days of the week specified in the schedule object, each day must be the date of the day, and not day name.
Within each day, have slots that correspond to the intervals specified for that day in the schedule object.
Each slot should contain a list of products sorted by their total time (duration + break time), from longest to shortest.
All products should be booked together. If all products do not fit within a slot, that slot should not be created.
The start time of each product in a slot should follow the order in the sorted list, with no break in between.
The slot times should be in UTC and formatted in ISO 8601.
Each product should include its start and end times, and its break time. Start and end times for each product should also include the break time.
The availability schedule should be generated for the booking period from the start date. The booking period is the longest booking period among all products, and the notice period is the longest notice period among all products.
The function should handle notice periods and booking periods from the today date, not the start date. If the notice period has already passed relative to the start date, it should not affect the availability.
The generated schedule should not include any slot that overlaps with a booked slot. You should provide a list of booked slots, each with a start and end time.

## Solution

The solution involves creating a function that takes the schedule object, a start date, and a list of booked slots as inputs and returns an array representing the availability over the specified booking period. The function first calculates the maximum notice period and the maximum booking period among all the products. It then iterates over each future date starting from the start date and for each date that matches a day in the schedule, it iterates over the slots for that day. For each slot, it generates 15-minute intervals and calculates the total time needed for all the products. If the total product time fits within the slot, it creates a new slot with start and end times and a list of products, each with its own start and end times (including the break time) and break time. After generating the slots, the function removes any slot that overlaps with a booked slot. The function then pushes the remaining slots into the day's slots. After processing all the slots for the day, if there are any slots for the day, it adds the day to the availability array.

This function handles the notice period and booking period relative to the current date. If the notice period has already passed relative to the start date, it does not affect the availability. If the notice period has not yet passed, it adjusts the start date accordingly. It also limits the availability to the longest booking period among all products.

The function will return an array of availability objects, where each object represents a day and contains an array of slots. Each slot is an object that includes a start time, an end time, and an array of products, where each product is an object that includes a product ID, a start time, an end time, and a break time. The start and end times for each product include the break time. All times are in UTC and formatted in ISO 8601.

## The Requirement Test Cases

It should generate slots for each day based on the intervals defined in the schedule.

It should generate slots at 15-minute intervals.

It should sort products within each slot by total time.

It should not generate a slot if all products do not fit within that slot.

It should not generate availability for the days not defined in the schedule.

### You could consider adding a few more test cases to increase coverage:

It should correctly calculate the maximum booking and notice periods: This would involve checking that the correct start and end dates are used to generate the availability.

It should not generate a slot if it falls within a notice period: This would require making sure that no slots are generated for days that fall within the notice period, relative to the current date.

It should handle booked slots correctly: This would involve providing a list of booked slots and checking that no slot in the generated availability overlaps with a booked slot.

It should include the break time in the start and end times for each product.

All times should be in UTC and formatted in ISO 8601.

It should adjust the start date if the notice period has not yet passed relative to the start date.

It should limit the availability to the longest booking period among all products.

It should not generate any slot that overlaps with a booked slot.

By covering these cases, you can ensure that your function is working as expected and handling various scenarios appropriately.
